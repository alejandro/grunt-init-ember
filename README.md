# grunt-init-nodeapp

> Create a Node.js app with [grunt-init][], including Nodeunit unit tests and a static file server.

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:alejandro/grunt-init-nodeapp.git ~/.grunt-init/nodeapp
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init nodeapp
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
